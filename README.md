# Simple neurnal network in C++

This repo contains a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) to classify MNIST digits
written in C++11. It's heavily inspired by the implementation in python from the
first chapter of the [Neural Networks and Deep
Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by  Michael Nielse.

It uses the [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) library for matrix
operations

Using the two hidden layers with units 64, 32 and a learning rate of 3 achieves
a 94.71% accuracy in the test set in 10 epochs.

The folder `dataset` includes a text representation of the original data
generated by Matlab.
